# React Native New Architecture Library Samples

This repo contains several branches that will help you understand how to setup your libraries for the React Native New Architecture. This should considered as a support material of the official migration guide.

Here you will find runs of the migration guide on empty projects. Every commit is documented and allows to follow over on every step.

Please find a list of the branches below, with more information on which kind of setup they're addressing.
